Discord has a message character count limit of 2000. Luckily, if you paste a longer message into the text box it will attach it as a `.txt` file. Discord then also lets you read `.txt` attachments in the web app. This is all very neat and handy, but it is completely impossible to work with for anyone on mobile.
